			<h3>It's ALL About Chez</h3> 
			<div>
				<p>What do you need to know about Chez? Well simply put, she is an Outrageously Stubborn (and beautiful) Party Queen.  Born and raised in London, Chez is one hell of a lose cannon with lots of opinions and pretty hair. And she loves cake - who doesn't, right?</p> 

				<p>Cheryl's hobbies consist of breakfast, lunch and dinner and she has a full blown obsession with boxes. You will always she her with anything to do with a box; from living in one, to partying in one to even gyming in one (favourite choice of exercise, obviously boxing) and (doubtlessly is) an absolute chatter box. Whilst out and about, carrying out her never ending mischievous antics, Chez is often found in any one of these boxes with her fellow BFF and top partner in crime, the Fairy Queen - who also lives in a box.</p>  

				<p>Cheryl's curious and vivacious nature coupled with her Scottish liver and ability to drink the house dry (whilst finding cake that is in anyway lurking on sight) is a marvellous and a remarkable talent that consequently means that NO party ever has a dull moment.</p> 

				<p>Chez and BFF both believe in unicorns, love at first sight and the boogie man and their aspirations are to become a cake in a box #TotalLifeFulfilment.</p>
